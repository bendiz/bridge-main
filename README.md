# MINI-BRIDGE

This is an educational version of bridge designed to teach the game to beginners. In Mini-Bridge, there is no bidding process.

After the cards are dealt, each player announces only their point count.

The partnership with the higher combined point count decides the trump suit and which partner will be the declarer. This version focuses on card play without the complexity of bidding.
